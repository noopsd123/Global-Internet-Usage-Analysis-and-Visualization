# Global-Internet-Usage-Analysis-and-Visualization
Analyzed global internet usage trends (2000-2023) for a DataCamp challenge. Cleaned and transformed data, used SQL for insights, and built interactive visualizations with Plotly. Explored digital divide, late adopters, and rapid growth regions. Vote for my project on DataCamp if you liked it! Feedback and contributions are welcome.
